## Project Summary

This project aims to build a management system which will provide a comprehensive view of the facilities at the Activities and Recreation Center at UIUC. The system will have an interactive web User Interface which will allow the students to book courts for sports and equipment (gym or otherwise) on a slot-wise basis. The users can also perform actions like viewing, updating, and cancelling the bookings in a hassle-free manner. This process will also optimize the booking of the sports equipment as well as the locations (e.g., courts, pools, etc.) so that there isn’t a burden on one sport. Furthermore, the system will also be integrated with other third-party sporting events (for example a football match at the Memorial Stadium) and allow people to book tickets for such events.
